# Applied AI – Computational Artist COMP 3710 - Applied Artificial Intelligence

This project aims to explore the intersection of art and artificial intelligence (AI) through the creation of computational art. Computational art refers to the use of algorithms, computer code, and software tools to create art that is unique, expressive, and often interactive.

## Description
This project involves using machine learning and other AI techniques to generate and manipulate visual  content. The focus is on exploring the creative potential of these tools and techniques, rather than using them for practical or commercial purposes.

Some of the techniques used in this project include:

Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
Neural style transfer
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
Data visualization

## Goals
The main goals of this project are:

To explore the creative potential of AI tools and techniques in the context of art and design.
To create interactive and engaging computational art that challenges traditional notions of art and creativity.
To encourage dialogue and debate about the role of AI in art and design, and its potential impact on the future of these fields.
Usage


## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome, and can take many forms, including:

Adding new AI techniques or algorithms to the project
Creating new visual or audio content using the existing tools and techniques
Improving the documentation or code quality of the project

### GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to your shiny new codespace! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Python and Jupyter notebooks.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.
